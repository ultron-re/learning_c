## Description:

If num is 10 and n is 2,

 10 -> 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 

Take 2 bits from LSB end of 10 (1 0) and return the corresponding decimal of that. 

So get_nbits(10, 2) function should return 2


## Pre-requisites:

Bitwise operators
Functions
Sample Execution: 

### Test Case 1:

Enter the number: 10

Enter number of bits: 3

Result = 2

### Test Case 2:

Enter the number: 15

Enter number of bits: 2

Result = 3
