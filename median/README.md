Description:

In probability theory and statistics, a median is described as the number separating the higher half of a sample, a population, or a probability distribution, from the lower half. The median of a finite list of numbers can be found by arranging all the numbers from lowest value to highest value and picking the middle one.
Example:
 For getting the median of input array { 12, 11, 15, 10, 20 }, first sort the array. We get { 10, 11, 12, 15, 20 } after sorting. Median is the middle element of the sorted array which is 12.
Pr-requisites:-

Loops
Arrays
Objective: -

To understand the concept of One-dimensional Arrays
Inputs: -

2 Integer Array of size 'M' and 'N' elements.
Sample execution: -
Test Case 1: 

Enter the 'n' value for Array A: 5
Enter the 'n' value for Array B: 5

Enter the elements one by one for Array A: 3 2 8 5 4
Enter the elements one by one for Array B: 12 3 7 8 5

Median of array1 : 4
Median of array2 : 7
Median of both arrays : 5.5                         
Test Case 2:
Enter the 'n' value for Array A: 5
Enter the 'n' value for Array B: 4
Enter the elements one by one for Array A: 3 2 8 5 4
Enter the elements one by one for Array B: 12 13 7 5
Median of array1 : 4
Median of array2 : 9.5                                      
Median of both arrays : 6.75
