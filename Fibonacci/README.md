## Description:

* In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers or Fibonacci sequence are the numbers in the following integer sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 . . .OR 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 . . .
* By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are either 1 and 1, or 0 and 1, depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
