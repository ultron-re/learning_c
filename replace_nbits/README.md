## Description:


a. Read number num from user.

b. Read number n from user.

c. Read number val from user

d. Fetch n number of bits from LSB end of val and replace in the last n bits of num.

e. Return new value of num. If num is 10 and n is 3 and val is 12

10 -> 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 

12 -> 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 

 The program should print result as 12 (1 1 0 0)

## Pre-requisites:

## Sample Execution: 

### Test Case 1:

Enter the number: 10

Enter number of bits: 3

Enter the value: 12

Result = 12

### Test Case 2:

Enter the number: 15

Enter number of bits: 2

Enter the value: 1

Result =  13
