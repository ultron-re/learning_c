## Description:


a. Read number num from user.

b. Read number n from user.

c. Read number pos from user.

d. Fetch n number of bits from given position 'pos' (starting from LSB) of num and return the decimal value of it.

If num is 12, n is 3 and pos is 4
         
      7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

12 -> 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 

The program should print 3 (0 1 1).
