Description: 

Read a number from the user. Check number of set bits in a given number. If number of set bits is odd, then Bit parity is odd. Similarly, If number of set bits is even, then Bit parity is even. 
For example, If num = 7, number of set bits = 3 which is odd number, so bit parity is odd. Similarly, if num = 3, number of set bits = 2, bit parity should be even
Sample Execution:
Test Case 1:

Enter the number : 7

Number of set bits = 3

Bit parity is Odd



Test Case 2:

Enter the number : 15

Number of set bits = 4

Bit parity is Even

Test Case 3:

Enter the number : 6

Number of set bits = 2

Bit parity is Even
