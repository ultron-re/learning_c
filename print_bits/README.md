## Description:


a. Read number num from user.

b. Read number n from user.

c. Do error checking
  -> If n is greater than integer size, assign n value as sizeof integer.

d. Print n number of bits of num from LSB end.

If num is 10 and n is 12, then print last 12 bits of binary representation of 10.

The output should be -> 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0

## Pre-requisites:

* Bitwise operators
* Functions

## Sample Execution: 

### Test Case 1:

Enter the number: 10

Enter number of bits: 12

Binary form of 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 

### Test Case 2:

Enter the number: 15

Enter number of bits: 4

Binary form of 15: 1 1 1 1
