## Description:

Suppose k = 3 (say taking 3 distinct characters ).

Let 3 distinct characters be a , b, c.

Suppose ‘n’ is the string length to be formed using ‘k’ distinct words.

Let n be 6

The string should be formed in such a way that there should not be any consecutive repetitions of the strings.

## Pr-requisites:-

Strings

Pointers

Arrays
## Objective: -

To understand the concept of

String manipulation

Note:- You don't have to evaluate this assignment. Just submit it. For your reference, you can run the code once

## Inputs: -

             Positive integers No of character C, Length of the string N and C distinct characters

## Sample execution: -
### Test Case 1:
Enter the number characters C : 3

Enter the Length of the string N : 6

Enter 3 distinct characters : a b c

Possible NRPS is abcbca

### Test Case 2:
Enter the number characters C : 3

Enter the Length of the string N : 7

Enter 3 distinct characters : a b a

Error : Enter distinct characters
